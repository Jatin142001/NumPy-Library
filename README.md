# 📊 NumPy Library – Learning Journey
### Welcome to my NumPy learning repository
### This project showcases my hands-on exploration of the NumPy library — the core package for scientific computing in Python.

## 📚 About NumPy
### NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a powerful library that provides support for:
- Large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
- A collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

### 🧠 Did You Know?
- NumPy was developed by Travis Oliphant in 2005 by merging the older libraries Numeric and Numarray.
- It's written in C, making it up to 50x faster than standard Python lists

## 🗂️ What's Inside
### This repo contains the following Jupyter Notebooks to help you understand different aspects of NumPy
